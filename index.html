        <h1> The Milky Way Galaxy</h1>
        <p>
            The Milky Way is a massive spiral galaxy containing over 200 billion stars, including our Sun.
            It's about 100,000 light-years wide and features a supermassive black hole at its center called Sagittarius A*.
            Our solar system is located about 27,000 light-years from the center, and it takes roughly 225 million years to orbit once.
            The Milky Way is still forming stars and will eventually merge with the Andromeda galaxy in a few billion years

        <h1>THE MOON</h1>
        <p>
            The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite and plays a vital role in stabilizing our planet’s tilt and causing tides. 
            It’s about one-quarter the size of Earth and has a surface covered in craters, mountains, and flat plains called “maria.” 
            The Moon orbits Earth every 27.3 days and always shows the same face due to synchronous rotation.
            It’s also the only celestial body beyond Earth that humans have visited.
